            The Students’ Union is an independent, self-governing student

          <p>
            St. Jerome's University (SJU) is a small, close-knit liberal arts
            school nestled next to the centre (and is part) of the University
            of Waterloo.
            <br> <br>
            I was first elected to the Students' Union in Fall 2016 as the
            Buisnesss Operations Liaison, shortly after I moved into the SJU
            Residence for my first year at Waterloo. When I joined Students'
            Union, it was the first time I saw what a student group was capable
            of accomplishing. It presented a stark contrast with my previous
            experinces in  high school, where only initial ideas, some planning,
            and mostly gruntwork were the responsibilies of students. I saw and
            was part of a group responsible for thousands of dollars of student
            money, that manages an online store, organizes an event for hundreds,
            and constanty seeks to improve the lives of students on campus.
            <br> <br>
            As I enter my tenure as Chief Financial Officer, I striving
            to modernize and optimize the way in which we organize ourselves and
            how we conduct buisness in order to better serve our students.
