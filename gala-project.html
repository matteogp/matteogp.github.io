            The St. Jerome's University Students' Union hosts the annual
            Green & Gold Gala. It is a huge gathering of students, staff, and
            faculty; bringing the community together for one night before the
            end of the year.
            <br> <br>
            Last year, our almost 300 guests all filled out a Google Form, then
            used a seperate spreadsheet to select their table. Shortly into the
            process, we recieved many requests about what tables will be where,
            or if we can place a table next to another, or who is near who as seating
            at the table was not being reflected by the spreadsheet.
            There was no way for people who
            are purchasing tickets to visualize the tables, leading to the many
            questions and requests that required accomodation.
            <br> <br>
            As Chief Financial Officer, I am the lead for almost all things
            related to the Gala, including ticket sales. I believe that creating
            a new system dedicated to ticket sales would not only provide value
            to the team, but raise our profile in the St. Jerome's community by
            creating a more professional experience for our guests.
            Of course, this project also provides me with an oppurtunity ot learn more about both
            frontend and backend development - two fields which I am excited to
            gain more experience with.
