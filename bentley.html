            In the summer after graduating from high school, I was able to
            acquire a job at local software company as a Quality Assurance intern.
            I spent the two months of summer before beginning univeristy working
            at the Burlington office of Bentley Systems. At the end of my time
            there, the Development manager sat down with me and offered me a
            position there as a Programming intern for the following summer as part of my
            co-op.
            <br> <br>
            When I returned, I spent my next 4 months primarily working on three
            different projects.
            <br> <br>
            My first task was completing an automated testsuite meant to be run
            nightly that had been started by a previous intern. The focus of the
            testsuite was on a complex copying process that copies objects known
            as "Failure Modes" from different types of maintenance analysis
            documents to any other type of maintenance analysis, either as a new or existing document. Using the
            foundation of a partially completed test framework created by the previous intern, I
            completed the implementation of the C# testsuite. When I left, it
            covered
            <br> <br>
            My second primary task was working alongside one of the Product
            Managers in the office to update the look and feel of the UI. There
            was an exisitng functionality that was meant to allow a user to
            customize the UI colours through editing an XML file, but the input
            was not behaving properly and many of the default colours were not
            being replaced. While refactoring the WinForms code that was part of
            the product's .NET framework, I was also in constant contact with
            the Product Manager about how best to make a new default colour that
            would not hinder the product's usability but still be in line with
            the designs of Bently's newer products. It was my first exposure to
            UI/UX design and the frontend side of development, and I am eager to
            delve deeper into the fields following my first experience with them.
            <br> <br>
            The third project which occupied the biggest chunk of my time was
            being part of a team of programmers tasked with productizing
            data loaders. These data loaders would take excel spreadsheets and create objects
            in the product with corresponding information. Most of the C++ code
            for the data loaders had previously been written by consultatnts for use
            by specific companies, but many changes were needed to bring the code
            up to product standards and work correctly within the latest version of the
            software. The process by which the data loaders interacted with a
            service of the product to create the objects was essentially an internal
            API, allowing C# code to be used when interacting with the rest of the
            C++ codebase.
