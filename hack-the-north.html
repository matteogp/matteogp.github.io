            I was fortunate enough to be able to join the Hack the North team input
            March 2017. Working together with a group of 36 other amazing people
            to help bring Canada's biggest hackathon to life has been an
            absolutely incredible experience for me both personally and professionally.
            <br> <br>
            As the Executive Assitant, my role gave me the oppurtunity to quickly
            begin to acquire context on how a group of students can accomplish
            a task as daunting has accomodating over 1000 hackers and hundreds
            more volunteers, sponsors and judges from around the world to come
            together in one place for an unforgettable 36 hours.
            <br> <br>
            My primary responsibilites include helping facilitate internal team
            communication, and ensuring all our documentation is in order to
            allow future teams to be able to look back at what we did this -
            helping
            them know what decisions we made, our reasons for doing so, and the
            results of them. In addtion to my day to day duties, I also had the
            flexibility to step up and take on more tasks involving the
            logsitics of the event as well as the work surrounding the judging
            process for submitted projects at the end of the event.
            <br> <br>
            I've yet to be part of a team as effective, dedicated, motivated,
            and hardworking as Hack the North.
