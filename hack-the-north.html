            I was fortunate enough to be able to join the Hack the North team in
            March, 2017. Working together with a group of 36 other amazing people
            to help bring Canada's biggest hackathon to life has been an
            absolutely incredible experience for me both personally, and professionally.
            <br> <br>
            As the Executive Assistant, my role gave me the oppurtunity to
            quickly understand on how a group of students can accomplish
            a task as daunting has accomodating over 1000 hackers, hundreds
            more volunteers and sponsors, and over a dozen judges from around the world to come
            together in one place for an unforgettable 36 hours.
            <br> <br>
            My primary responsibilites include helping facilitate internal team
            communication and ensuring all our documentation is accurate and accessbile to
            allow future years' teams to be able to look back at what we did this year -
            helping
            them know what decisions we made, our reasons for doing so, and the
            results of them. In addtion to my day to day duties, I also had the
            flexibility to step up and take on more tasks involving the
            logsitics of the event, as well as organizing many aspects of the judging
            process for submitted projects at the end of the event.
